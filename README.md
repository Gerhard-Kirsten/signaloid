# Airfoil Lift Generation Model

This repository contains a C program that models the lift generation of an airfoil using the Bernoulli equation and other relevant physical principles. The model takes into account the temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed around the airfoil to compute the lift force. The program is designed to be run on the Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform.

## Model Description

The lift force \( L \) generated by an airfoil can be computed using the following formula:

\[ L = 0.5 \times \rho \times V^2 \times C_L \times A \]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the air density (kg/m³)
- \( V \) is the air velocity (m/s)
- \( C_L \) is the coefficient of lift (dimensionless)
- \( A \) is the wing area (m²)

### Air Density Calculation

Air density is calculated based on the temperature, pressure, and humidity using the formula:

\[ \rho = \frac{p_d}{R_d \times T} + \frac{e}{R_v \times T} \]

where:
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin (K)
- \( p_d \) is the partial pressure of dry air (Pa)
- \( e \) is the actual vapor pressure (Pa)
- \( R_d \) is the specific gas constant for dry air (\( 287.05 \) J/(kg·K))
- \( R_v \) is the specific gas constant for water vapor (\( 461.5 \) J/(kg·K))

The actual vapor pressure \( e \) is calculated as:

\[ e = \left( \frac{\text{humidity}}{100} \right) \times e_s \]

where \( e_s \) is the saturation vapor pressure, given by:

\[ e_s = 6.112 \times \exp \left( \frac{17.67 \times T_C}{T_C + 243.5} \right) \times 100 \]

and \( T_C \) is the temperature in Celsius.

### Wind Speed Calculation

The wind speed \( V \) is determined using the pressure difference measured by a Pitot tube:

\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times (\text{total pressure} - \text{static pressure})}{\rho}} \]

where:
- \( \text{total pressure} \) is the total (stagnation) pressure (Pa)
- \( \text{static pressure} \) is the static pressure (Pa)
- \( \rho \) is the air density (kg/m³)

## Assumptions

1. **Data Source:** The data for the pressure, humidity, and temperature comes from the Cape Town weather service, specifically using hourly data for the month of July. We create distributions based on this empirical data.
   - Sources for data: [Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/en/station/68816) and [Foreca](https://www.foreca.com/South_Africa/Cape_Town/hourly)
2. **Temperature:** Assumed to be measured in Celsius and converted to Kelvin for calculations.
3. **Humidity:** Provided as a percentage and used to calculate the actual vapor pressure.
4. **Pressure:** Given in Pascals and includes both dry air and vapor components.
5. **Lift Coefficient (\(C_L\)):** Assumed constant for simplicity, though it can vary with angle of attack and airfoil shape.
6. **Wing Area (\(A\)):** Presumed known and constant for the given airfoil.

## Program Structure

The program consists of the following main components:
1. **Main Function:** Reads input parameters, calculates air density and wind speed, and computes the lift force.
2. **Helper Functions:** Include calculations for air density, vapor pressure, and wind speed based on provided weather data.
